      </h2>
      <p class="m-case-study-section-blurb">
        When I joined the team, Richline Digitalâ€™s home-grown eCommerce CMS had a mobile experience that had gone
        untouched for a number of years. The CMS was about ten years old when I joined, and our mobile traffic to the
        site was, by then, sizable and growing. After discussions with key stakeholders, we decided that we needed to
        implement a number of changes to support our users as they engaged with our brands on mobile devices.

        <p class="m-case-study-section-blurb">
          This project was very much UX focused, as brand guidelines for our portfolio brands had already been
          established. I owned the redesign of the mobile experience within our CMS as a solo designer. To begin, I
          analyzed our user data using Google Analytics and Hotjar (I soon switched to Fullstory) to identify problem
          areas for users (drop-off, dead clicks, filtering trouble, etc).</p>
        <p class="m-case-study-section-blurb">
          The stakeholders for this project were our company's three brand owners, as well as our VP of Engineering,
          Marketing Director, and CEO. I worked with the stakeholders through numerous iterations to address varying
          brand needs and prioritize our high-value features. To identify high-value features, I worked closely with our
          marketing team and leveraged Google Analytics and Hotjar/Fullstory to better understand user behaviors.

        Outcome
      </h2>
      <p class="m-case-study-section-blurb">
        Features from the design work were broken into development stories and gradually implemented into Richline
        Digitalâ€™s CMS. I also worked with the marketing and development teams to A/B test feature variations as they
        were rolled into production. Major improvements like optimized filters, item suggestions, and an improved
        checkout flow resulted in a substantial increase in conversions and checkout totals.

        This project was very UX focused, but I wanted to play with the visual design. I reimagined the design as a
        mobile app from the Product Page through the Checkout flow. ðŸ™Œ
